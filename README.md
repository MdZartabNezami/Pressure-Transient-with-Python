# Pressure-Transient-with-Python
I developed a comprehensive program that simulates a Pressure Buildup Test, a crucial procedure in reservoir engineering. This program processes the well test data obtained during the buildup phase to accurately determine key reservoir properties, specifically reservoir permeability and the skin factor. By analyzing pressure changes over time, the program enables precise evaluation of the reservoir's ability to transmit fluids and the extent of any near-wellbore damage or enhancement, which is reflected in the skin factor. This detailed analysis helps in optimizing well performance and planning further reservoir development strategies.
